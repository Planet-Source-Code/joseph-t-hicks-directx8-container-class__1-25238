'The only global variable you need for DirectX8... my very own jDXEngine
'
'This class was written by Joseph Hicks to help those that are having difficulties
'with DirectX8 graphics (god knows that I am!!!).  As of the time of this writing, it is
'very simplistic, but still gives the general idea of what needs to be created, initialized
'when creating a DirectX8 application.  Feel free to use this code as you see fit, but if you
'make any major modifications or feature enhancements, could you PLEASE be so kind as to
'email me a copy of the changes so I can learn more, too? (jhicks@hsadallas.com)
'I will continue to update this class as I learn more about DirectX8, and as others send
'me their contributions (assuming that they actually do... we're on the honor system here
'guys...) and will continue to post updates when they are warranted. :)  If you have any
'questions about this class, please don't hesitate to email me at any of the following email addys:
'jhicks@hsadallas.com (work)

'Thanks for your interest in my work! =Ã¾
